An archery tactics style game with a [sourceforts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceForts)-esque twist.

Issues:

- [x] Two players can grab the same Manipulatable
- [x] You can bring the flag past a close-radius wall
- [x] F3 hero is selectable - bug - still a bug?
- [ ] Visibility is frustrating
- [ ] There is no ability to perfm a "drop" during Manipulate
- [x] Jump spell
- [ ] Opponents should be unselectable/reselect main hero periodically
- [ ] Terrain manipulator hero
- [ ] Caster hero
- [x] Spawn points are messed up
- [ ] Force 1 Force 2
- [ ] Random skeleton spawning in ZERO2? maybe off-by-one error on players iterator
- [ ] Manipulating own flag should just send it back
- [ ] After dying you can simply F2, lol
